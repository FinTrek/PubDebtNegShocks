To generate the figures for this model:

1. Run the file "GenerateK", which generates the approximating function for K_t. The file will save the coefficients of the approximating polynomial (as well as other model parameters) in a matrix called ktmatrixPolyFitLarge.

2. Run the file "SteadyState", which loads the saved matrix and computes simulations for the utility effects of a transfer, generating the corresponding graphs.
