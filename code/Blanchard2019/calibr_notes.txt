n_1 = 1
n_2 = 0
x_1 = average wage (steady-state) absent the transfer (see top of p. 1213)
x_2 = 0
beta = fit average value of marginal product of E[R] in Cobb-Douglas case (see p. 1213)
gamma =	residual from equation
k20 = ?

alpha = 0.33 or 1/3
epsilon = infinity or 1 (linear or Cobb-Douglas)
delta = 0
z0 = ?
rho = ?
mu = 1.0786, fit average value of marginal product of E[R] in the linear case (see p. 1213)
sigma_an = 0.04 (Blanchard notes this is high)
sigma = 0.2 (sqrt(25)* 0.04, see p. 1213-1214, this calibration is central because he has to artificially make it high because suffers from extreme case of equity premium puzzle)

Hbar = [0.05, 0.20] of pre-transfer saving

calibrate 
beta, mu, gamma, sigma

1) Calibrate beta and mu separately using Cobb-Douglas and linear production case
rt_an =[0.00, 0.04]
rt = [0.00, 1.67]
rbart_an = [-0.02, 0.01]
rbart = [-0.40, 0.28]

I don't understand and need to show why p. 1213 ln(R^f_{t+1}) - ln(E[R_{t+1}]) = -gamma * sigma ** 2

Looks at average welfare across simulations, i.e., average discounted realized lifetime utility
